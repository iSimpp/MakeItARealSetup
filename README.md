# Hello! ðŸ‘‹  

This repository contains scripts for automating setups I created because ***I'm getting a new PC next month!*** My goal is to have everything ready to go with just one or two clicks.  

Don't expect this README to be like a 30 page manual on how to use, It's just really for personal use, just figured I should make it public.

## Scripts Overview  

### `SetPaths.bat`  
This script is for configuring system paths. Use it if you accidentally reset your paths or need to restore them.  

### `InstallStuff.bat`  
A lightweight script for installing applications that are, let's say, *a bit nonexistent*.

### Notes  
- This README will be updated occasionallyâ€”roughly every commit or two.  
- Feel free to explore and adapt these scripts to suit your needs!
