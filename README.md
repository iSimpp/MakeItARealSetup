# Alo!

This is just some automating Setups that I made, because ***I'm buying a new PC new month*** so I just wanna have everything Setup from the click of One or Two clicks.

I will guide a bit, not much because I'm the one who made this, so I already know how it works.

So, SetPaths.bat, is just for setting paths (Only use if you reset your paths accidentally).

#### This README will be updated every once in a while every commit or two.
